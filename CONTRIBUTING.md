# Contribute to the Banking Kata (Java)

Do you find something is missing in the Banking Kata
(e.g., something that you commonly do at work, but don't see it in the Kata)?

Do you have an idea for improving something in the code base, or new functionalities?

If yes, you're welcome to contribute.

1. See the existing tickets https://github.com/valentinacupac/banking-kata-java/issues (see unassigned tickets, or you can add a new ticket).
2. If you want to "reserve" the ticket for yourself, you need to write a comment on the ticket so that I can set you as assignee (because GitHub only allows me to set assignees to people who commented).
3. Fork the project https://github.com/valentinacupac/banking-kata-java/fork and work on your fork.
4. After you've finished, make a pull request (PR), we will review and merge your changes.
5. If anything is unclear in the instructions above, you can raise a support ticket.

Thank you once again!
